## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The plugin is highly configurable through `config.yml`, allowing you to customize every aspect of the AI helper's behavior and appearance.

### Key Configuration Areas

**Backend Integration**: Configure your AI backend endpoint URL and connection settings. The plugin is designed to work optimally with the separate [Battista AI Backend application](https://github.com/Manuel-Materazzo/battista-ai-backend).

**Knowledge Filtering**: Set up source filters to target specific knowledge subsets, such as server-specific folders in your document repository. This enables contextual responses tailored to your server's needs.

**Tab Menu Integration**: Control whether the AI helper appears in the player TAB menu (requires ProtocolLib) and customize its skin and display name.

**Chat Activation Methods**: Fine-tune how players can interact with the AI:

- **Tagging**: Enable/disable chat tag detection (default: `@Helper`)
- **Auto-detection**: Configure automatic question recognition for messages ending with `?`
- **Response formatting**: Customize the chat prefix for AI responses

**Rate Limiting**: Configure character limits and timeouts to prevent abuse while maintaining responsive gameplay.

**Messages**: All player-facing text is fully customizable, including error messages, prompts, and system notifications.
They also support [pseudo-mardown](https://github.com/Manuel-Materazzo/battista-ai-spigot/blob/master/SYNTAX_HELP.md)!

The configuration file includes detailed comments explaining each setting and providing examples for optimal setup.
